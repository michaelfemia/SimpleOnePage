# SimpleOnePage
More intuitive CMS for a basic single page website with various child blocks:
• Text: headers, paragraphs, quotes, tables
• Embeds: YouTube & Vimeo
• Images: widescreen images, modal galleries, small filmstrips.
• File Links: .pdfs or online articles with image previews.
• Interface improvements and more element types to follow.

Set-Up should take less than 10 minutes.

1. Upload all of the contents of the SimpleOnePage folder to your root directory. i.e. do not create [yourDomain].com/SimpleOnePage/ 
2. Open the interface you use for working with your databases. (e.g. PHP My Admin), create a new database: name it whatever you want, and choose your database username and password. You'll need those credentials in a minute.
3. Copy the contents of [yourDomain.com]/setup.SQL into the database interface and run the code to create all of the necessary tables for the CMS. 
4. Go to [yourDomain].com/setup.php. Fill out all of the required fields, and press Set Up Site
5. Enter in your desired login credentials, and press Sign Up
6. Start building your site. 
7. Protect setup.sql and setup.php: change the permissions, or copy them to your computer and delete them from your server.
