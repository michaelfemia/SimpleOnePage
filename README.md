# SimpleOnePage
More intuitive CMS for a basic single page website with various child blocks:
• Text: headers, paragraphs, quotes, tables
• Embeds: YouTube & Vimeo
• Images: widescreen images, modal galleries, small filmstrips.
• File Links: .pdfs or online articles with image previews.
• Interface improvements and more element types to follow.

Set-Up should take less than 10 minutes.

1. Upload all of the contents of the SimpleOnePage folder to your root directory. i.e. do not create [yourDomain].com/SimpleOnePage/ 
2. Open the interface you use for working with your databases. (e.g. PHP My Admin), create a new database: name it whatever you want, and choose your database username and password. You'll need those credentials in a minute.
3. Copy the contents of [yourDomain.com]/setup.SQL into the database interface and run the code to create all of the necessary tables for the CMS. 
4. Go to [yourDomain].com/setup.php. Fill out all of the required fields, and press Set Up Site
5. Enter in your desired login credentials, and press Sign Up
6. Start building your site.
